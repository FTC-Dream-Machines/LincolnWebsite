	<H2 class="BidenText"><center>Biden, he is way more qualified for the position of presidency. He not only has 40+ years more of experience in politics that Trump. He has served as vice-president under the Obama administration and senator for 36 years. He has worked on quarantine policies that could of help stop the spread of COVID 19 if Trump didn't get rid of it. He has proven in his years of being a politician that the people he serves comes first not himself or his friends.</H2></center>

 	<h3 class="RegText"><center>Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. born November 20, 1942) is an American politician who served as the 47th vice president of the United States from 2009 to 2017. He served as a United States Senator for Delaware from 1973 to 2009. A member of the Democratic Party, Biden is the Democratic presidential nominee for the 2020 election, running against the incumbent, Donald Trump. Biden unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988 and 2008.</h3>

 	<h3 class="RegText"><center>Trump's political positions have been described as populist, protectionist, and nationalist. He entered the 2016 presidential race as a Republican and was elected in a surprise victory over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, although he lost the popular vote. He became the oldest first-term U.S. president, and the first without prior military or government service. His election and policies have sparked <u><mark>numerous protests</mark></u>. Trump has made many <u><mark>false or misleading statements</mark></u> during his campaign and presidency. The statements have been documented by fact-checkers, and the media have widely described the phenomenon as unprecedented in American politics. Many of his comments and actions have been characterized as <u><mark>racially charged or racist</mark></u>.</h3></center>

 	<h3 class="RegText"><center>During his presidency, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, citing security concerns; after legal challenges, the Supreme Court upheld the policy's third revision. He enacted a tax-cut package for individuals and businesses, rescinding the individual health insurance mandate penalty. He appointed Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. In foreign policy, Trump has pursued an America First agenda, withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade negotiations, the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the Iran nuclear deal. He imposed import tariffs which triggered a trade war with China, recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and withdrew U.S. troops from northern Syria. Trump met three times with North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un, but talks on denuclearization broke down in 2019. Trump <u><mark>reacted slowly</mark></u> to the COVID-19 pandemic; he minimized the threat, <u><mark>ignored or contradicted many recommendations from health officials</mark></u>, and <u><mark>promoted false information about unproven treatments and the availability of testing</mark></u>.</h3></center>
 	<br>
 	<h3 class="RegText"><center>A special counsel investigation led by Robert Mueller found that Trump and his campaign <u><mark>welcomed and encouraged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election</mark></u> under the belief that it would be politically advantageous, but did not find sufficient evidence to press charges of <u><mark>criminal conspiracy</mark></u> or coordination with Russia. Mueller also investigated Trump for <u><mark>obstruction of justice</mark></u>, and his report neither indicted nor exonerated Trump on that offense. After Trump solicited the investigation by Ukraine of Joe Biden, who later became his Democratic opponent in the 2020 presidential election, the House of Representatives <u><mark>impeached</mark></u> him in December 2019 for <u><mark>abuse of power and obstruction of Congress</mark></u>. The Senate acquitted him of both charges in February 2020.</h3></center>
